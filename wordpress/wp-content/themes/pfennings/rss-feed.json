[{"title":"A beautiful morning to celebrate friendships and farming with a coffee break in the field.  There were tears and laughter as we are wishing Kathryn well in her retirement.  Her beautiful smile, warm presence and enthusiasm for all things healthy and good will be greatly missed.  We hope she will continue to join us for coffee often.  The delicious cake pops from Frost Dessert Shoppe made it extra sweet!","author":"Pfenning's Organic Farm","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pfenningsfarm\/photos\/a.442353424592.201271.267357574592\/10153236086269593\/?type=1","img":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/10153236086269593\/picture?width=9999&height=9999","date":"01-05-2015 14:58:32","label":"facebook","filter":"social","row_id":1},{"title":null,"author":"Pfenning's Organic Farm","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/californiagrillofthepajarovalley\/photos\/a.234895453331724.1073741828.220008621487074\/448870958600838\/?type=1","img":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/448870958600838\/picture?width=9999&height=9999","date":"23-04-2015 02:20:11","label":"facebook","filter":"social","row_id":2},{"title":"MY FAVOURITE PEOPLE ARE BACK IN CANADA\ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\udc9b\ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\udc9b it's been a long winter without these crazy Jamaicans #pfenningsfarm","author":"madelineshantz","link":"https:\/\/instagram.com\/p\/1g9QTADq0Z\/","img":"https:\/\/scontent.cdninstagram.com\/hphotos-xap1\/t51.2885-15\/e15\/11142393_361153890743469_774504870_n.jpg","date":"16-04-2015 00:01:51","label":"instagram","filter":"social","row_id":3},{"title":"Seedlings waiting for transplanting - romaine, green and red leaf lettuce, and collard greens.
